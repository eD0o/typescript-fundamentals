# 3 - Objects, Arrays & Tuples

## 3.1 - Objects & Property Types

### 3.1.1 - Object properties declaration

To define a mutable object, you can do it like this:

```ts
//declaring the types
let car: {
  make: string;
  model: string;
  year: number;
} = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2004,
};

// allowed
car.make = "Ford";

//not allowed
car = { make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2020 };
```

Using `const` allows you to change properties, but not the entire object at once:

The `?` signal means it's optional and not required prop.

```ts
//without declaring the types, but ts will infer
const car = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2004,
  color: "Black", // optional value
};

// allowed
car.make = "Ford";
car.model = "Focus";
car.make = 2020;

//not allowed
car = { make: "Ford", model: "Focus", year: 2020 };
```

Using `readonly` makes properties immutable:

```ts
const car: {
  readonly make: string;
  readonly model: string;
  readonly year: number;
} = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2004,
};

// Any attempt to change will result in an error
car.make = "Honda"; // ~ error
```

### 3.1.2 - Object Functions

It's possible to define functions that take objects as parameters:

```ts
const myCar = {
  make: "Toyota",
  model: "Corolla",
  year: 2004,
};

function printCar(car: { make: string; model: string; year: number }) {
  console.log(`${car.make} ${car.model} (${car.year})`);
}

printCar(myCar);
```

## 3.2 - Index Signature

Sometimes it's necessary to represent a type for dictionaries, where `values of a consistent type can be retrieved by keys`.

Letâ€™s consider the following collection of phone numbers:

```ts
const phones = {
  home: { country: "+1", area: "211", number: "652-4515" },
  work: { country: "+1", area: "670", number: "752-5856" },
  fax: { country: "+1", area: "322", number: "525-4357" },
};
```

To type it, it'd be like:

```ts
const phones: {
  [k: string]: {
    country: string;
    area: string;
    number: string;
  };
} = {
  home: { country: "+1", area: "211", number: "652-4515" },
  work: { country: "+1", area: "670", number: "752-5856" },
  fax: { country: "+1", area: "322", number: "525-4357" },
};
```

Or in a shorter way:

```ts
const phones: { [k: string]: string } = {};
```

> However, you can't add values that are of a different type or more complex structures, such as nested objects as in the first scenario.
