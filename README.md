### 1.1.2 - Three parts of TypeScript

1 - Programming language: the language `itself` (with `added features` like types).
2 - Compiler: `converts the code` into clean, readable JavaScript.
3 - Language server: enables features like `autocompletion in IDEs` like VS Code.

### 1.1.3 - Benefits

- Provides `early feedback` on potential issues at compile time.
- Makes your intent clear, allowing for `better maintainability and easier debugging`.
- `Reduces runtime errors` by shifting type errors to the development phase.
